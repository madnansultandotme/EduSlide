## 1. Introduction to the Problem

### 1.1 Introduction

The **EduSlide AI** is a complete software solution developed to enhance the efficiency of educators in creating PowerPoint presentations. In today's academic environment, preparing visually appealing and informative slides is a time-consuming task, requiring significant effort to summarize content, add visuals, and design slides effectively. EduSlide AI addresses this challenge by providing a streamlined, AI-powered approach to presentation creation.

EduSlide AI includes user-friendly features that automate the workflow for teachers and educators. Users can upload PDFs, eBooks, or input topics, and the system generates at least 10 slides per topic or chapter with summaries and visuals. The platform also supports full eBooks, creating slides chapter by chapter. By automating these tasks, EduSlide AI reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and allows educators to focus on teaching rather than slide preparation.

This document provides a detailed overview of the system's architecture, key features, and operational benefits. EduSlide AI enables educators to create organized, visually engaging, and interactive presentations quickly, ultimately enhancing the learning experience for students and supporting effective teaching practices across the classroom.
